# leopard-subpixel

A leopard-pattern-based computer vision algorithm

## Try it

Assuming you have gcc and *ImageMagick* (especially `convert`) installed running `./test.sh` should do the job.


## Try it with a real scene

### 1. Run `generate`

Generates phase shifted leopard patterns.

Use `./generate -help` to see the list of options.


### 2. Capture images

*TODO* : fill this section.


### 3. Run `solve`

Generates a correspondance map between camera pixels and projected pixels (aka the leopard patterns previously generated).

Use `./solve -help` to see the list of options.


### 4. Run `subpixel`

*TODO* : code that program and fill this section.
